# JARVIS · Claude Code Memory HUD

A local voice-and-graph front end for **Claude Code**. The brain is your own
`claude` CLI, so it runs on your Claude subscription — no API key, no per-token
billing. The memory is a folder of markdown you can open in Obsidian.

Nothing is hosted. The server binds to `127.0.0.1` only.

Based on [Itsme23476/jarvis-claude-code](https://github.com/Itsme23476/jarvis-claude-code),
whose history is kept in this repository. This copy adds streamed speech, a
long-lived Claude process, the holographic HUD skin with a speaker that moves
with the voice, an optional conversation panel, and long-term memory.

## Quick start with Claude Code

Paste this into a fresh Claude Code session:

> Clone https://github.com/Nukasanikarthikeyi/Jarvis and set it up for me.
> Read SETUP-PROMPT.md in the repo first and follow it — it has the rules that
> matter. Short version: it runs on my Claude subscription so never use `--bare`
> and never set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY; ask me for my Fish Audio key and put it in
> `.env` without printing it back; help me pick a voice; then start it and verify
> it actually speaks before telling me it works.
>
> One thing to get right: Fish Audio performs `[square brackets]` as delivery
> directions and never speaks them, so write JARVIS's lines to be spoken —
> `[dry]`, `[warm]`, `[lightly amused]`, or free-form like `[the calm tone of
> someone who has done this a thousand times]`. No markdown, no emoji, numbers as
> words, deadpan throughout.

## What it is

Two things fused together:

- **The HUD** — command matrix, live telemetry, action log, reactor core.
- **The memory graph** — every note in your vault as a node, every `[[wikilink]]`
  as an edge. Click a node and only it and its neighbours light up. Shift-click a
  second node to trace the shortest path between them.

The graph is not decoration. When you ask JARVIS something, the server finds the
vault notes that answer it, injects them into Claude's system prompt, **and
focuses the graph on the note it used** — so you watch the answer come out of a
specific file.

## Run it

```bash
cd Jarvis
python3 seed_vault.py     # writes a sample agency vault (skip if you have one)
./start.sh
```

Then open <http://localhost:8720>.

Requirements: Python 3.9+ and Claude Code on your PATH. No pip installs — the
whole server is standard library.

## The vault

`vault/*.md`. Frontmatter sets the type, wiki links make the edges:

```markdown
---
type: client
updated: 2026-08-18
---

# Copper & Rye

Independent distillery. Won through [[Outbound campaign]] and
qualified with [[Lead qualification]].
```

Types drive the colours in the filter legend: `client`, `project`, `call`,
`note`, `concept`, `person`, `invoice`, `proposal`, `sop`, `brief`, `campaign`.

Point it at a real Obsidian vault with `JARVIS_VAULT=~/Documents/MyVault`. The
graph reloads from disk automatically when files change, or on `/graph`.

## Commands

| command | does |
|---|---|
| `/recall <query>` | search the vault |
| `/remember <fact>` | keep it in long-term memory |
| `/memory` | hear what is in long-term memory (`/memory <query>` searches the vault) |
| `/forget <memory>` | drop one memory |
| `/graph` | reload memory from disk |
| `/goal`, `/profile`, `/personality` | standing context injected into every turn |
| `/mission [task]` | mission queue |
| `/status` | runtime, model, vault size |
| `/new` | fresh Claude session |

Anything else goes to Claude Code with the relevant vault notes attached.
`Esc` cancels a running turn. `/` focuses the input.

## Long-term memory

JARVIS remembers what you tell it, across restarts. Say "remember that my
sister's birthday is the third of March" and it is kept; mention in passing
that you take your coffee black and it keeps that too. Ask about either next
week, in a new conversation, and it knows. "Forget what I told you about my
coffee" drops it.

Each memory is one more note, in `vault/memory/`, so it is plain markdown you
can read, edit or delete, and it shows up in the graph as a cyan node. A memory
that mentions something already in the vault is linked to it — remember
something about Tom Rivers and the note hangs off Tom Rivers.

- **Saving costs no time.** Claude ends its reply with a hidden
  `<remember>…</remember>` tag; the server strips it before the reply is shown
  or spoken and writes the note. No tool call, so no pause.
- **Recall.** The full list is given to Claude when a conversation starts and
  again whenever it changes, and memories are also found by the same keyword
  recall as the rest of the vault.
- **Forgetting moves, it does not delete.** The note goes to `vault/.trash/`
  (where Obsidian puts deleted notes too) and can be dragged back.
- **`JARVIS_MEMORY`** sets how eager it is: `auto` (the default) saves when
  asked and when you share something lasting; `ask` saves only when asked;
  `off` turns long-term memory off.

`/profile` is still there and unchanged; it is a short list kept in
`state.json` and sent with every turn.

## Voice

Ships mute — the browser's own `speechSynthesis` voice, which is the robotic
default. Add a Fish Audio key to `.env` and it speaks through that instead:

```
FISH_AUDIO_API_KEY=...
FISH_AUDIO_MODEL=s2.1-pro-free
FISH_AUDIO_VOICE_ID=612b878b113047d9a770c069c8b4fdfe   # Jarvis (MCU)
```

Find voice ids with `GET https://api.fish.audio/model?title=<search>`. Check
remaining quota with `GET /wallet/self/package`.

The key stays server-side. The browser only ever receives mp3 bytes from
`/api/speak`, so it never appears in devtools, page source, or a screen capture.

Verified against the live API: `POST https://api.fish.audio/v1/tts` with the
model as a header, `reference_id` selecting the voice. Speech-to-text uses
`POST /v1/asr` (multipart field `audio`). The bundled skills under
`.agents/skills/` carry the full contract, including the WebSocket streaming
endpoint if you later want token-by-token speech.

Swapping voices means editing `.env` and restarting — the value is read at
startup.

Speech is streamed. Each finished sentence is sent to Fish while Claude is still
writing the next one, and the audio plays as it arrives, so JARVIS starts talking
about two seconds after you ask instead of after the whole reply has been
rendered. This relies on `FISH_AUDIO_LATENCY=balanced` (the default); `normal`
makes Fish hold every clip until it is complete. `Esc` stops it mid-sentence.

## Live voice

Click **Live** next to the ask bar and it goes hands-free: talk, stop, and it
sends by itself. An utterance ends after ~950ms of silence; anything under 350ms
is ignored as a cough rather than a sentence. The trigger threshold is calibrated
from your room's own noise floor at startup rather than hardcoded, so a noisy
room does not fire constantly. A level meter under the dial shows it hearing you.

Detection is suspended while a turn is running **and** while audio is playing, so
JARVIS never transcribes its own reply and talks to itself. Use headphones
anyway — echo cancellation is on, but speaker bleed into a hot mic is still the
easiest way to confuse it.

Tune in `ui/app.js` if the pacing is wrong for you: `SILENCE_MS` (raise to ~1400
if it cuts you off while you pause), `MIN_SPEECH_MS`, `MAX_SPEECH_MS`.

## Listening

Local `whisper.cpp` is used automatically when `whisper-cli`, `ffmpeg` and a
`ggml-*.bin` model are present — offline, free, about half a second for a short
clip, and it works in any browser. Install with `brew install whisper-cpp` and
drop a model anywhere the `WHISPER_MODEL` path points.

Whisper narrates silence — feed it a silent clip and the base model reliably
returns "you" or "thank you". Those artifacts are filtered server-side so live
mode does not fire phantom turns; `yes`/`ok`/`sure` are deliberately left alone
because they are real confirmations.

Two fallbacks exist and both have a catch. Fish Audio ASR (`/v1/asr`) is billed
from a **separate API-credit balance** to TTS, so it can 402 while speaking works
fine. The browser's own recogniser relies on Google's speech service, which
Chromium builds shipped without a Google key — Brave especially — reject with a
bare `network` error.

## Demo fixtures

`JARVIS_DEMO=1` (the default) intercepts a handful of scripted questions so a
recording is deterministic: the greeting, the agency numbers, competitor
research, and the campaign-replies chain. Matching is tolerant of speech-to-text
drift. Set `JARVIS_DEMO=0` to send everything to the real Claude.

## Configuration

All optional, all in `.env` — see `.env.example`.

| var | default | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `JARVIS_PORT` | 8720 | |
| `JARVIS_VAULT` | `./vault` | point at any Obsidian vault |
| `JARVIS_MODEL` | Claude default | `opus`, `sonnet`, … |
| `JARVIS_PERMISSION` | `bypassPermissions` | full tool access, no prompts — see Security notes |
| `JARVIS_WORKDIR` | `~` | what Claude can see |
| `JARVIS_MEMORY` | `auto` | long-term memory: `auto`, `ask` (only when asked) or `off` |
| `CLAUDE_CMD` | auto-detected | absolute path if `claude` isn't on PATH |

## Security notes

- Localhost bind, per-launch random API token, same-origin checks, bounded
  request sizes.
- **JARVIS runs with `--permission-mode bypassPermissions` by default.** A
  headless `claude -p` can't show you a permission prompt, so this is what lets
  JARVIS actually use your connected tools (Gmail, Calendar, Drive, web search)
  instead of silently failing on every one. The flip side: it can also **send
  email, delete data, and run shell commands with no confirmation**, driven by
  whatever it hears — a misheard instruction can take a real, irreversible
  action. Set `JARVIS_PERMISSION=acceptEdits` in `.env` for a tighter blast
  radius (you lose unattended tool use), and only point it at input you trust.
- `.env` and `state.json` are gitignored. Never commit them.
- **Never add `--bare` to the Claude invocation.** It forces `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
  auth and would bypass your subscription entirely.
- Your subscription is for you. Running this on a VPS for your own phone access
  is still one user; exposing it so other people can talk to it is account
  sharing. If you productise this, ship the code and have each person
  authenticate their own Claude Code.
