# Setup prompt

Paste everything below into a fresh Claude Code session. It is written to be
self-contained: Claude clones the repo, installs the Fish Audio skill, asks you
for one API key, and hands you a running JARVIS.

---

I want you to set up my own JARVIS assistant. Clone and run this repo:

https://github.com/Nukasanikarthikeyi/Jarvis

## What this is

A local voice-and-graph HUD driven by Claude Code. A small Python server (standard
library only, no pip installs) shells out to the `claude` CLI in headless mode and
streams the result to a browser front end. There are three parts:

- **Brain** — `runtime.py` keeps one `claude -p --input-format stream-json --output-format stream-json --include-partial-messages --verbose`
  process alive, started before the first question, and maps its event stream to
  HUD events. Relaunching the CLI per turn costs 3–6 seconds, so do not go back to
  that. Because it invokes the CLI directly, it authenticates with my **Claude
  subscription** — no API key, no per-token billing.
- **Memory** — `memory.py` reads `vault/*.md` (Obsidian-style markdown with YAML
  frontmatter and `[[wikilinks]]`) and turns it into a force-directed knowledge
  graph. On every question it injects the most relevant notes into Claude's system
  prompt and focuses the graph on the note it used.
  It also holds JARVIS's long-term memory: what I tell it to remember becomes a
  note in `vault/memory/`. Claude saves by ending a reply with a hidden
  `<remember>…</remember>` tag, which `memory.TagFilter` strips before the reply
  is shown or spoken — keep it that way, a tool call there would add seconds of
  silence. `<forget>…</forget>` moves a memory to `vault/.trash/`.
- **Voice** — `voice.py` speaks through Fish Audio. The key stays server-side; the
  browser only ever receives mp3 bytes from `/api/speak`.

## Steps

1. Clone the repo and `cd` into it.
2. Run `python3 seed_vault.py` if `vault/` is empty (writes 133 sample notes).
3. Install the Fish Audio agent skill so you have the exact API contract:
   `npx skills add https://docs.fish.audio`
   (It is also vendored in the repo at `.agents/skills/fish-audio-api/SKILL.md`.)
4. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and ask me for my Fish Audio API key. Put it in
   `FISH_AUDIO_API_KEY`. **Never print the key back to me and never commit it** —
   `.env` is already gitignored.
5. Pick a voice: `GET https://api.fish.audio/model?title=jarvis` (or any search
   term), show me a few options with their ids, and put my choice in
   `FISH_AUDIO_VOICE_ID`.
6. Start it with `./start.sh` and open http://localhost:8720.
7. Verify before telling me it works: check `/api/status` reports
   `server_voice: true`, POST a line to `/api/speak` and confirm you get real mp3
   bytes back, then send a question through `/api/run` and confirm Claude answers
   from the vault.

## Hard rules

- **Never add `--bare` to the claude invocation.** It forces `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
  auth and silently bypasses my subscription, so I would start paying per token.
- Do not set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in the environment for the same reason.
- The server must stay bound to `127.0.0.1`. It mints a random per-launch API
  token and checks Host/Origin on every request — keep all of that.
- Do not commit `.env` or `state.json`.

## Fish Audio — the part that makes this sound like JARVIS instead of a train announcement

This is the most important thing to get right, because it decides what text you
generate. Read it carefully.

### Delivery tags

Fish Audio reads **square brackets as stage directions, not as words**. They are
performed and never spoken aloud. So this input:

```
[sighing] [dry] I've moved your three o'clock. Again.
```

...produces an actual sigh and a dry delivery, and the words "sighing" and "dry"
are never read out. This is verified behaviour, not a guess: an open-domain tag of
twelve words produces *shorter* audio than the same line untagged, which is only
possible if the tag is consumed rather than spoken.

Syntax depends on the model family:

| Model | Syntax | Vocabulary |
|---|---|---|
| `s2.1-pro`, `s2.1-pro-free`, `s2-pro` | `[brackets]` | **free-form natural language** |
| `s1` (legacy) | `(parentheses)` | fixed list, must match exactly |

This project uses `s2.1-pro-free`, so **use square brackets and write whatever you
want inside them**. There is no separate API parameter — tags go inline in `text`.

Documented categories: 24 basic emotions (`[happy]` `[sad]` `[angry]` `[excited]`
`[calm]` `[nervous]` `[sarcastic]`), 25 advanced (`[anxious]` `[nostalgic]`
`[determined]` `[resigned]`), 6 tone markers (`[whispering]` `[shouting]`
`[soft tone]` `[emphasis]`), 11 audio effects (`[laughing]` `[sighing]` `[gasping]`
`[yawning]`), and 5 special effects (`[break]` `[long-break]`
`[audience laughing]`). Full list:
https://docs.fish.audio/api-reference/emotion-reference.md

Two things the fixed list undersells:

- **Intensity modifiers work**: `[very excited]`, `[slightly sad]`.
- **Open-domain descriptions work**, and this is the real party trick:
  `[the calm, measured tone of someone who has done this a thousand times]`
  is a valid tag. You are not limited to a vocabulary.

### How this shapes the text you write

Every reply JARVIS gives is read aloud. So when you write replies — in demo
fixtures, in the system prompt, anywhere — write them **to be spoken**:

- Put one or two delivery tags per reply, placed where the register actually
  changes. More than that reads as noise.
- No markdown, no bullet points, no headings, no emoji. None of it survives TTS.
- Numbers as words when they will be spoken: "six thousand euros", not "€6000".
- Dry understatement over enthusiasm. JARVIS is deadpan; that is the whole
  character. A JARVIS that sounds cheerful undercuts the entire thing.

The repo already does this in two places — `VOICE_DIRECTION` in `commands.py` (the
system prompt appended to every real Claude turn) and the hardcoded demo replies.
Match that style if you add more.

### Other Fish Audio facts worth knowing

- **TTS**: `POST https://api.fish.audio/v1/tts`, JSON body, model as an HTTP
  header (`model: s2.1-pro-free`), `reference_id` selects the voice, `format: mp3`.
  Response is raw audio bytes with no JSON wrapper.
- **ASR**: `POST /v1/asr`, `multipart/form-data`, field name `audio`. **Billed from
  a separate "API credit" balance**, not the subscription/platform balance that TTS
  uses — so TTS can work while ASR returns `402 Insufficient API credit`. If that
  happens, say so plainly rather than reporting the mic as broken.
- **83 languages in one model**, with automatic detection and the same voice
  identity across all of them. You do not declare the language in the request.
- **Voice cloning**: `POST /model` (multipart) with 10–30 seconds of clean audio,
  returns a voice id to use as `reference_id`. Not available through the Fish MCP
  server — use the REST endpoint.
- **Latency**: roughly 90ms time-to-first-audio on the model side. What you measure
  end to end will be much higher, because it includes the LLM turn and network.
  Do not conflate the two.

## Live voice mode

The mic button is a **Live** toggle, not push-to-talk: it watches the input level
and cuts an utterance after ~950ms of silence, then sends automatically. Two
things in `ui/app.js` must not be broken if you touch it:

- Detection is suspended while `running` is true and while `Live.speaking` is
  true. Remove either guard and JARVIS transcribes its own reply as the next
  question and loops forever.
- `Spoken.close()` resolves on the audio's `ended` event, not on `play()`, and
  `Live.speaking` stays true until it does. If you make it resolve early,
  listening resumes over the tail of its own voice.

Speech is streamed: each finished sentence goes to `/api/speak` while Claude is
still writing, and the mp3 is played as it arrives. That needs
`FISH_AUDIO_LATENCY=balanced` (the default) — in `normal` mode Fish sends nothing
until the whole clip is rendered.

Local whisper hallucinates on silence ("you", "thank you"), so `voice.py`
filters those. Leave `yes`/`ok`/`sure` unfiltered — they are real answers.

## Speech-to-text caveat

The browser's Web Speech API relies on Google's speech service. Chromium builds
shipped without a Google API key — Brave most notably — fail instantly with error
`network`. The front end tries Fish Audio ASR first and falls back to the browser,
so if I am in Brave and have no Fish ASR credit, listening will not work. Tell me
that directly rather than debugging my microphone.

## When you are done

Tell me: the URL, which voice you set, whether server-side voice and listening are
each working, and how many notes are in the vault. Then suggest three questions I
can ask it.
